# Crop Fertilizer Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes crop and fertilizer data to provide insights and recommendations for optimal farming practices. It utilizes machine learning techniques to predict suitable fertilizers based on soil conditions, crop type, and environmental factors.

## Features
- **Crop Recommendation System**: Predicts the best crop to grow based on soil and environmental parameters.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation System**: Suggests the optimal fertilizer based on soil nutrients and crop type.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights into soil health and fertilizer efficiency.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented using Decision Trees and other classification algorithms.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
