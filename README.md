# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

This repository contains the **Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System** project, which involves data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to provide insights into agricultural data. The project is divided into **Week 1** and **Week 2** tasks, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** for better predictions.

## Key Features

- **Week 1: Basic Data Exploration**
  - Understanding dataset structure, missing values, and data types.
  - Generating summary statistics and visualizations.
  - Initial insights into crop and fertilizer data.

- **Week 2: Advanced Data Analysis & Feature Engineering**
  - Visualizing feature distributions and relationships.
  - Identifying outliers using boxplots.
  - Performing correlation analysis and encoding categorical features.

## Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Week 1 task focuses on:
- **Basic Exploration**:
  - Viewing the first and last few rows of the dataset.
  - Checking dataset shape, column details, and data types.
  - Identifying missing and duplicate values.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Summary statistics of numerical features.
  - Distribution of target features.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Pair plots for relationships between features.
  - Heatmaps for correlations.
  - Distribution plots and count plots for categorical variables.

## Week 2: Advanced Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

The Week 2 task includes:
- **Feature Distributions**:
  - Histograms for each numerical feature.
- **Feature vs Target Relationships**:
  - Scatter plots between features and crop labels.
- **Outlier Detection**:
  - Boxplots to identify extreme values.
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Heatmaps to analyze feature relationships.
- **Encoding Categorical Features**:
  - Mapping crop labels to numerical values for machine learning.

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Loading**:
   - Load the `Crop_Recommendation.csv` and `Fertilizer_Prediction.csv` datasets.

2. **Week 1 - EDA**:
   - Perform data cleaning, missing value handling, and visualization.

3. **Week 2 - Feature Engineering**:
   - Analyze trends, detect outliers, and apply feature transformations.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generate visually appealing plots to communicate findings effectively.
