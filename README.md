## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The uploaded Jupyter Notebook includes:

- **Basic Exploration**:
  - Viewing the first and last few rows of the dataset.
  - Checking dataset shape, column details, and data types.
  - Identifying missing and duplicate values.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Summary statistics of numerical features.
  - Distribution of target features.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Pair plots for relationships between features.
  - Heatmaps for correlations.
  - Distribution plots and count plots for categorical variables.

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Loading**:
   - Load the `Crop_Recommendation.csv` and `Fertilizer_Prediction.csv` datasets.

2. **EDA**:
   - Perform data cleaning, missing value handling, and visualization.

3. **Insights**:
   - Analyze trends and relationships in the data to derive actionable insights.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Generate visually appealing plots to communicate findings effectively.
