# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a **Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System**. The system is designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals make data-driven decisions about which crops to grow and the fertilizers to use based on environmental and soil conditions.

---

## Key Features

- **Crop Recommendation**: Recommends the best crop to grow based on soil parameters and environmental factors.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Suggests suitable fertilizers to optimize crop yield.
- **Data Analysis**: Provides detailed insights into the data, including statistical summaries and visualizations.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Offers visually appealing plots for better understanding.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements robust algorithms for accurate predictions.
